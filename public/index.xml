      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you had told me two years ago that, two years from then, I would be in Bangalore, doing primarily video-editing as a job, for my friend&amp;rsquo;s financial advisory company, I&amp;rsquo;d probably laugh it off as completely insane. I have found myself in similar situations over the past decade or so, where my life at one point in time, would probably have been unrecognisable to me 2-4 years prior. For a big chunk of my life, I was barely in touch with what I really wanted to do, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that that has gradually been getting further and further away from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
