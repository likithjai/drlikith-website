        <content type="html" xml:base="https://drlikith.com/blog/on-home/">&lt;p&gt;I have moved cities&#x2F;countries at least six times now, with the total number of times I have moved easily reaching double digits. Suffice it to say I have learnt a thing or two about the concept of “home”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-home-means-to-me&quot;&gt;what home means to me&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of home that I learnt a long time ago, that it is a particular place, that you might long for while you are away from it, didn’t quite resonate with me. The view that home is a feeling, however, did make sense to me on multiple levels.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, is a person who grew up in a very abusive, hell-hole of an environment doomed to be forever alien to the concept?
Of course not, but this perspective didn’t come easily to me. With each and every house that I lived in, with each new city that I grew even somewhat comfortable with navigating, I learnt more about myself as much as I did about the place itself and a few people around me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-few-things-i-ve-learnt&quot;&gt;a few things I’ve learnt&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that feeling at home in a place requires, in somewhat equal parts, getting to know and being more comfortable with both what is around you, as well as what is within you.
Building a life in a place that is new to you demands that you understand your values, your likes, tastes, passions, and of course, the things that make you uncomfortable.
I have also found that when you are even somewhat in touch with your internal value system, you make it easier for yourself to be able to make a given place feel like home.
My experiences have also taught me that the people you grow up depending on seldom stay necessary. Take this with a grain of salt, but we often grow up idolising and learning that these people are essential to our growth, comfort, etc., but it so happens that they are just a couple of other people. And just like any other people, they could be good for you, or they could be bad for you. I’m not advocating for them to be held to the same standards as a stranger in your life, but I am encouraging a tiny bit of accountability and critical thinking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-situation-today-forever-a-nomad&quot;&gt;the situation today: forever a nomad?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been back in Bangalore for two years now; a place I have previously lived in for around 12 years at a stretch, which is still my longest stretch yet. This time though, it’s been two years, and in several ways, it has been the best yet, and in other ways, it has been just the &lt;em&gt;cleansing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; my soul needed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time (probably ever) I feel like I want to really stay in a place, and &lt;em&gt;I&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; get to make that decision, as opposed to a visa. For the time being, I don’t even crave travel that much, although I’m fairly sure that that will return.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;closing thoughts&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of, and also because of, all the twists and turns, I am genuinely glad about where I am right now. The future feels a bit easier to realistically think about. There is one, albeit massive in its own way, less uncertainty in my life and it feels good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://drlikith.com/blog/coming-back-to-life/">&lt;p&gt;If you had told me two years ago that, two years from then, I would be in Bangalore, doing primarily video-editing as a job, for my friend’s financial advisory company, I’d probably laugh it off as completely insane. I have found myself in similar situations over the past decade or so, where my life at one point in time, would probably have been unrecognisable to me 2-4 years prior. For a big chunk of my life, I was barely in touch with what I really wanted to do, but I’m happy to say that that has gradually been getting further and further away from the truth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;career&quot;&gt;career&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending five years learning the ins and outs of how atoms behave, what electrons do, and their implications thereof, I slowly came to a painful realisation towards the end: While I genuinely enjoyed certain aspects of it, I didn’t really want to keep doing research for the rest of my career. I knew this beyond a shadow of doubt during my postdoc position for which I did DFT (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;10.1021&#x2F;jp960669l&quot;&gt;Density Functional Theory&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) for a primarily experimental research group. Of course this pursuit itself taught me a lot of lessons that have come to be invaluable to me, as a person, and this is true for the topic too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I successfully pivoted towards data analytics and I did enjoy it a lot, and thought, for a second, that I had found my path. Working for Deloitte (for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mtb.com&#x2F;personal&quot;&gt;M&amp;amp;T Bank&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a client) was a lot of fun. It brought  the problem-solving aspect that I enjoyed during my &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;citations?user=jrlwT9IAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;research&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and combined that with a fast-paced, high-stakes environment with a supportive manager, and in this environment, I daresay I thrived.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All seemed well, until I decided to come back to Bangalore, and continue along the same career path. Things didn’t work out as I expected, and the next thing I knew, I had been job hunting for about a year and a half. I had been learning video editing (using only &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ffmpeg.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at the time, mind you) as a hobby. Cut to a couple of months later, and I was now primarily a video editor at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;getwizr&#x2F;?hl=en&quot;&gt;Wizr Wealth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a company that I am proud to say my friend had started a few years ago. Some of the perks include:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to use whatever software I want for the work that I do. I get to use python, emacs, and linux itself, and it really does feel like home in a lot of ways (looking at you, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mse.ufl.edu&#x2F;people&#x2F;name&#x2F;nancy-ruzycki&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dr. R&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to use my camera on a regular basis, and I have gotten to learn lots of things about studios, lighting, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not bound by rigid hierarchies and meaningless (to me) rules which is typical, but of course, not always true, in larger organisations (in my experience at least)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to code, but I don’t really &lt;em&gt;have&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;climbing-journey&quot;&gt;climbing journey&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first tried rock climbing in Seattle. It brought me uncomfortably and scarily close to my fear of heights&#x2F;falling. But I started to notice something when I started trying it more. I had managed to go around 5 years being in Golden, Colorado, being so sure of my fear, that I always refused to try it even though it was practically everywhere. I noticed myself mentally so engaged with the activity, that I wasn’t able to think of anything else. It wasn’t too many things to hold at once in my mental bandwidth&#x2F;scope of attention, but, a little bit more importantly, not too few either. Which was what has made continuing to go to the gym much harder for me. Not only was it the right level of mentally engaging, I also noticed my sleep improving, my general energy levels, mental state, and just generally how I felt about myself all saw improvements. Gainesville had a smaller-sized, more cave-inspired routes matching the climbing territory of the gym. I even used to take my climbing shoes when I travelled for work, and tried to go there before having to head back. This has been a lot of fun too. Currently, I’ve been going to one in Bangalore for probably around a year-and-a-half now, and I have liked it a lot, although there definitely have been some off-seasons, I am genuinely surprised that I have persisted this long with something even after ’setbacks’. I just sent my second Level-4, which, I guess is equivalent to V3-V4 at least. It wasn’t easy at all. It hasn’t been easy, or at least, I remember it being easier to do some moves that take more strength for me now, but the progress I have been noticing in myself has been consistent. I decided to invest in myself and bought the 6-month membership, which is about to enter the last month in a few days. It has been very rewarding to go, and as a bonus, the more I go, the lesser each session costs. I participated in a boulder social event where I had a lot of fun, and did pretty well in identifying the levels I was relatively comfortable with and made the most of the time. I did try some harder ones, most of them turned out to be level-4s, one of which I projected the entire day today and finally sent (completed) it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static site generators like Zola are perfect for blogs, documentation, and simple websites.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-static-sites&quot;&gt;Why Static Sites?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static sites offer several advantages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast loading times&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - No database queries or server-side processing&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - No server-side code means fewer attack vectors&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosting flexibility&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Can be hosted anywhere that serves static files&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version control&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Your entire site can be tracked in Git&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-zola-workflow&quot;&gt;The Zola Workflow&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write content in Markdown&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create templates using the Tera templating engine&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;zola build&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to generate your site&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy the &lt;code&gt;public&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; folder to your web server&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s that simple! This post demonstrates how easy it is to add new content to your Zola site.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
