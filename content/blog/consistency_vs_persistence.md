Like a lot of people out there, I have had a long rollercoaster of a relationship with consistency. Not only would I set these ridiculously high standards for myself, I would pile on that with the expectation of consistency. It left me crushed and feeling miserable about myself for a long time.

One day, as a thought experiment, I let go of consistency as a bare minimum level of acceptance for myself, just to see what effect it would have on me, how I felt, and what happened to the relationship between me and the thing. Here&rsquo;s an oversimplified example: Journaling has been a habit close to my heart for most of my life. I have journaled in one form or another for over 2 decades now, but I&rsquo;ve rarely been &rsquo;consistent&rsquo;. My go-to response to whenever I fell off the so-called wagon was to be disappointed in myself. *How could I do this AGAIN!?!* Over time, I&rsquo;d develop this mental barrier against journaling, and it would feel like this ridiculously annoying chore that I&rsquo;d always end up feeling &rsquo;too tired&rsquo; for. (by the way, the recent learning that while physical tiredness is definitely a thing, but tiredness is also sometimes an emotional response!! this blew my mind!) What started with that tiny thought experiment was a radical overhaul of my internal narrative. Letting go of the expectation of consistency meant that I was actually more likely to get back into it after a &rsquo;dry spell&rsquo;, with just as much enthusiasm as the last time and not having to deal with all the drama that came with it. Overall, that sounds like a net positive effect to me, and that is without even accounting for the fact that I don&rsquo;t feel as bad about myself on a regular basis.

Persistence is well aware of the fact that there will of course be periods in my life where I won&rsquo;t be able to prioritize all the things that bring me joy and health, but is also self-assured that I trust myself to periodically check in with myself and, most importantly: listen. This story has played out in similar ways for me with a lot of my creative pursuits, including writing itself. I&rsquo;ve gotten better at bringing things back, or getting back into things after a while and not associating it with a sense of self-shame. It still stings. My perfectionist tendencies aren&rsquo;t dormant or anything; I&rsquo;ve just gotten better at not taking them as seriously *all. the. time.* I used to think if I let go of these standards, it would be a slippery slope to the absolute oblivion of never doing anything. That though, is just another example of a voice that needn&rsquo;t be given that much attention. I have, in fact, found that when my basic needs are being met, I generally do enjoy and improve and follow all these callings, just at a different pace than I would have expected.

So, here&rsquo;s a takeaway: Show up, even if shabbily/imperfectly; don&rsquo;t let perfectionism paralyze you. Set your future self up for success, don&rsquo;t make them feel bad about themselves, be nice to them, and they will have a better shot at doing fun and fulfilling things.
