I have moved cities/countries at least six times now, with the total number of times I have moved easily reaching double digits. Suffice it to say I have learnt a thing or two about the concept of &ldquo;home&rdquo;.


# what home means to me

The definition of home that I learnt a long time ago, that it is a particular place, that you might long for while you are away from it, didn&rsquo;t quite resonate with me. The view that home is a feeling, however, did make sense to me on multiple levels.

For instance, is a person who grew up in a very abusive, hell-hole of an environment doomed to be forever alien to the concept?
Of course not, but this perspective didn&rsquo;t come easily to me. With each and every house that I lived in, with each new city that I grew even somewhat comfortable with navigating, I learnt more about myself as much as I did about the place itself and a few people around me.


# a few things I&rsquo;ve learnt

I believe that feeling at home in a place requires, in somewhat equal parts, getting to know and being more comfortable with both what is around you, as well as what is within you.
Building a life in a place that is new to you demands that you understand your values, your likes, tastes, passions, and of course, the things that make you uncomfortable.
I have also found that when you are even somewhat in touch with your internal value system, you make it easier for yourself to be able to make a given place feel like home.
My experiences have also taught me that the people you grow up depending on seldom stay necessary. Take this with a grain of salt, but we often grow up idolising and learning that these people are essential to our growth, comfort, etc., but it so happens that they are just a couple of other people. And just like any other people, they could be good for you, or they could be bad for you. I&rsquo;m not advocating for them to be held to the same standards as a stranger in your life, but I am encouraging a tiny bit of accountability and critical thinking.


# the situation today: forever a nomad?

I have been back in Bangalore for two years now; a place I have previously lived in for around 12 years at a stretch, which is still my longest stretch yet. This time though, it&rsquo;s been two years, and in several ways, it has been the best yet, and in other ways, it has been just the *cleansing* my soul needed.

For the first time (probably ever) I feel like I want to really stay in a place, and *I* get to make that decision, as opposed to a visa. For the time being, I don&rsquo;t even crave travel that much, although I&rsquo;m fairly sure that that will return.


# closing thoughts

In spite of, and also because of, all the twists and turns, I am genuinely glad about where I am right now. The future feels a bit easier to realistically think about. There is one, albeit massive in its own way, less uncertainty in my life and it feels good.
