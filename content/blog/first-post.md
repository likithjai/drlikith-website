# My First Post

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a simple example of how content works in Zola.

## Markdown Support

Zola supports full Markdown syntax, including:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- [Links](https://www.getzola.org/)

## Code Blocks

You can also include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Zola!");
}
```

## Lists

Here's a simple list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And that's the basics of creating content in Zola!
